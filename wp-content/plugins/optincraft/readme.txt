Grab attention, capture leads, and boost conversions fast. OptinCraft makes building high-converting popups effortless with a simple drag-and-drop canvas builder in a fully WordPress-friendly environment. No coding, just results.

#### Build Beautiful Popups with Drag & Drop Simplicity

OptinCraft comes with an intuitive drag & drop builder that lets you create custom popup designs easily. You can add text, images, countdown timers, and buttons while previewing your changes live.

No coding, no confusion: just simple, visual control over your popup’s look and behavior. Every design is 100% responsive, so your popups look great on desktop, tablet, and mobile.

#### Choose from Multiple Popup Styles

OptinCraft gives you flexibility to design Popups that fit your campaign goals perfectly. You can use:

* **Lightbox popups** for email subscriptions or offers
* **Floating bar popups** for announcements or notifications
* **Slide-in popups** to promote new deals
* **Sidebar popups** for persistent visibility

Each popup style feels modern and non-intrusive, keeping your visitors engaged without hurting their experience.

#### Drag & Drop Canvas Builder in the Shadow of Gutenberg

At first glance, it feels like you’re working in Gutenberg but it’s actually a powerful drag & drop canvas editor that works like Canva. Every click, every move flows naturally, letting creativity take the lead. Interesting, right? 

#### Mobile-specific Popups That Perform

A large number of traffic comes from mobile users. OptinCraft ensures your popups are fully optimized for mobile screens, loading fast and displaying beautifully.
You can even create **mobile-specific popups** to deliver device-targeted experiences. That means smoother engagement, better conversions, and a more enjoyable browsing experience for every visitor.

#### Multi-Step Campaign

A Multi-Step Campaign guides prospects through a structured journey that increases engagement and conversions by breaking the opt-in process into simple, intentional steps. 

Instead of asking for too much information upfront, OptinCraft captures micro-commitments first, then uses conditional logic and smart segmentation to deliver highly relevant messages and follow-ups. 

This approach reduces friction, improves lead quality, and allows you to personalize nurturing sequences based on user behavior and intent, resulting in higher opt-in rates, stronger trust, and better overall campaign performance.

#### Smart Targeting & Trigger Controls
OptinCraft gives you complete control over **where**, **when**, and **to whom** your popups appear. Use smart targeting options like:

* **Device targeting** (desktop, mobile, tablet)
* **Page-level targeting** (show popups on specific pages)
* **Conditional display** (custom rules for visibility)
* **Target new visitors or returning visitors** (PRO)
* **Geo-location targeting** (PRO)

**Trigger your popups with behavior-based controls such as:**

* On page load
* After inactivity
* Click count
* Page Scrolled (PRO)
* On page exit intent (PRO)
* Custom selector click (PRO)
* On hover (PRO)

These options let you build campaigns that appear at the right time without annoying your audience.

#### Create Urgency with Timers and Schedules

You can boost conversions by adding **countdown timers** to your popups. Perfect for flash sales or limited-time offers, timers add urgency and drive instant action.

OptinCraft also lets you **schedule popups** with specific start and end times. Run seasonal promotions, limited-time events, or recurring announcements even when you’re offline.

#### Stunning Templates for Every Campaign

No design experience? No problem. OptinCraft includes a **bunch of pre-made templates** crafted to look professional and convert effectively.

Each template is customizable with your branding, colors, and fonts. You can use **Google Fonts** to personalize your popups and match your website style.

These ready templates save hours of design work and help you launch beautiful popups in minutes.

#### Measure Success with Detailed Analytics

OptinCraft’s powerful analytics dashboard helps you track performance in real-time. You can view:

* **Campaign analytics** for impressions, clicks, and conversions
* **Device-wise data** to see which popups perform best on mobile or desktop
* **Country-wise analytics**
* **Page-wise and browser-wise analytics**

These insights help you optimize your designs, adjust targeting, and continuously improve your campaigns.
