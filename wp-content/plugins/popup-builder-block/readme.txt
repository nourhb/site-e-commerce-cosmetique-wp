You can apply multiple include and exclude conditions for a popup on your entire website, specifically based on page, posts, archives, etc.

### ⚒️ Leverage the Power of PopupKit Blocks
The effectiveness of a popup relies not only on timing and placement. The right engagement of the popup relies on the coherence and accuracy of your design. PopupKit becomes the right popup builder tool by providing dedicated elements like **Container, Form, Countdown Timer, Heading, Advanced Paragraph, Advanced Image, Icon, Button**, etc.

### 🎨 Showcase Visually Stunning Popups

To craft an ideal popup experience, the PopupKit allows you to **customize the overlay’s appearance** along with styling the container and close button to perfection.

### 🧲 Get Visitors Hooked with Impressive Animation

### 🎮 Gamification Popup

Turn user engagement into conversions with [interactive gamified popups](https://wpmet.com/plugin/popupkit/gamification-popup/?utm_source=org&utm_medium=readme).

For example, the first step could ask a simple question like "Yes, I want to learn more," followed by an email request, and then a final offer or coupon. Unlike traditional popups with long forms, this approach guides users smoothly, reducing friction and making it easier for them to complete the process. The result? More conversions and less intimidation.

### 🛒 WooCommerce Exit Intent Popup

Recover lost sales before they happen. PopupKit’s WooCommerce Exit Intent Popup detects when a visitor is about to leave and instantly shows targeted offers, cart reminders, or coupon codes.

### 🛠️ [Easy Drag-and-drop Editor Popup Builder](https://wpmet.com/plugin/popupkit/drag-and-drop-popup/?utm_source=org&utm_medium=readme)
Want to create a popup campaign from scratch? PopupKit welcomes you with a builder interface you are already familiar with. You can easily drag and drop an element into the editor area. And, all campaign settings like triggers, animations, display rules, frequency, and geolocation targeting are neatly placed in the right sidebar.

### ⏰Countdown Timer
Get the easiest way to create FOMO among visitors while displaying popups. PopupKit has a countdown timer block to help you showcase limited-time discount popups. And, you can apply various countdown timer styles like **Circle, Box, Flip, Linear, Crest,** etc. Once the countdown reaches zero, display a custom expiry message to inform your visitors.

### ⏩ Set Popup campaign Frequency

With PopupKit, you can specify exactly who sees your popups and how often they appear. For better personalization, you can choose to target New visitors, Returning visitors, or Everyone and define display frequency options like **Once per day, Every visit, Every session, Once every few days, or even once every few visits**.

For example, you can show a popup exclusively to new visitors, inviting them to subscribe to your newsletter or sign up for a premium package.

### 📊 Popup Campaign Analytics
PopupKit comes with [integrated analytics](https://wpmet.com/plugin/popupkit/analytics/?utm_source=org&utm_medium=readme) that let you track which popup campaigns are converting, where leads come from, and what can be improved. You can monitor the **number of total views, clicks, conversions, and conversion rate per campaign** — and filter those results by: **campaign date range, device, browsers, location, traffic source.**

It also displays real‑time data to identify drop‑offs (users who saw but didn’t convert), so you can retarget or adjust campaigns for improved performance. Overall, you can export reports, see how your performance has trended over time, compare campaigns and learnings (for example, device or location performance) to help improve subsequent popups.

### 📑 Page Level Targeting for Popups
PopupKit allows you to target which pages your popups are displayed on- individual page, posts, product pages, checkout and across the whole site. For that, you may use advanced filters (page slug, category, post type …) to make popups relevant regarding visitor intent and page context.

This accuracy ensures that your visitors only see popups relevant to the page they’re already on, resulting in better engagement and fewer pointless interruptions and higher conversion rates.

### 🗺️Geolocation Targeting

[Geolocation targeting](https://wpmet.com/plugin/popupkit/geolocation-target/?utm_source=org&utm_medium=readme) makes popups more personalized and results in higher conversions. PopupKit allows you to run campaigns in a specific country, city, or region by setting multiple conditional rule groups. Because of location targeting, you can show language-specific poups, promotions, shipping notices, etc.

### 🎨 Popup Customization

Whether you choose to create your popup from scratch or use a pre-made template, you’ll end up designing stunning popups for your website. To craft an ideal popup experience, the PopupKit allows you to customize the overlay’s appearance along with styling the container and close button to perfection.

### ⏱️Simplify Campaign Management with Built-In Scheduling

Take advantage of [PopupKit's built-in scheduling](https://wpmet.com/plugin/popupkit/popup-scheduling/?utm_source=org&utm_medium=readme) feature. Create multiple popup campaigns at once and set different launch times for each. Along with saving your time, you can also use an advanced scheduling system for better engagement.

PopupKit allows you to schedule campaigns based on your website’s timezone or your visitors’ local time, all through an intuitive calendar-style interface.

### ⚖️ Popup A/B Testing
PopupKit supports an [A/B testing feature](https://wpmet.com/doc/popupkit-ab-testing/?utm_source=org&utm_medium=readme) to make data-driven decisions that optimize conversion rates and user experience. You can easily compare multiple popup designs to automatically determine the highest-converting variant. With real-time performance tracking, it ensures you’re always using the most effective design to engage visitors and drive results.

### 📵 Control Popup Visibility by Device

PopupKit simplifies popoup display to the right audience even more by allowing you to create a campaign based on device type. Whether you want a campaign to appear only on mobile, desktop, or tablet, just select your preferred option; no extra steps or hassle required.

### 🚫IP Blocking

Another way to become regional-specific while displaying a popup is IP Blocking. You can enter specific IP Ranges and Specific IPs to avoid certain regions or users. In this way, your campaign becomes more relevant and prevents spam, bots, and unnecessary impressions to provide accurate conversion rates.

### 🌐 Display Popups Anywhere on the Website
One of the best things about the PopupKit plugin is that you can add it anywhere on your website. So, you don’t need to configure additional settings conventionally. For instance, simply place the popup block in the header area to add a bar popup.
