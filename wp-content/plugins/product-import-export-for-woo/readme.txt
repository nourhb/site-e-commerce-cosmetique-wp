The WooCommerce CSV importer plugin takes a CSV (Comma-Separated Values) file as input. You must create a CSV (UTF-8 Encoded) file and enter the product details in a structured format.

This is to match each field of a CSV file to the field of a particular product, which otherwise the Admin needs to input manually. For example, the post_title field gets mapped to the product name, and the regular_price field gets mapped to the regular price of the product.

You can create the CSV from scratch or export products to get the format of the CSV. You can use a spreadsheet program, such as LibreOffice, Microsoft Excel, OpenOffice, or Google Sheets, to create and modify the CSV file. Save this file with the extension ".CSV."

After entering all details about products in a spreadsheet, you can import products to your WooCommerce store. With this plugin, you can also export and download product details as a CSV.
